## Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition
- Auto starts as the map begins. Note: A map needs to be started beforehand in the current game session or it won't detect, but afterwards it will work every time.
- Autosplit upon map victory, as well as (optionally) upon completed start of the next map (the latter useful for quarantaining RTA menu times to their own separate split)
- Game Time Display & Tracker
-> Keeps track of IL PBs in Full Run contexts by means of gold splits. (Note: Victories/defeats always occur on the whole second mark, in case you're wondering why all your Game Time Golds are such perfect numbers :) ) 
-> Time lost due to map restarts / loading saves can (optionally) be added to its own separate split at the end. 
-> Unfortunately, for now this game time tracker also saves invalid IL times (eg. due to loaded saves) as golds. You will have to manually undo these splits for now to prevent them from overwriting your legitimate golds.
- Tested with current versions only. Can add older versions if you provide me with the memory addresses. Contact: discord.gg/lotsofs  
- I try to update this when the game updates, but I might miss it or forget. Let me know if this is the case.    

## Carmageddon 2
- Autosplitter  
- Tested with Steam version only  
- In case of a game update on Steam, this might break. Please contact me immediately if this happens and I haven't noticed.  
- Also contact me if you're using this at all. I don't expect anyone to use this, but it would be awesome if they did.  

## Far Cry 2  
- Load remover for V1.03 & V1.00 No CD.    
- Simulates a proper game time, since the game-provided timer is bad (pauses in menus, continues in loadings). Thanks to Pitpo for helping me test this. Available for V1.03 & V1.00 No CD.  
- Autostart, autosplit on main mission pass (excluding buddy rescues) available for V1.00 No CD for now. V1.03 doesn't work yet, as the game currently keeps crashing on me and I can't look for addresses. Legit V1.00 will never work because there is no way of getting past that DRM anymore, even legitimately, to my knowledge.   
- If you want me to add support for V1.01 V1.02 or V1.03 or it doesn't work on your game (it wouldn't surprise me) contact me discord.gg/lotsofs  

## Serious Sam 2  
- Load remover.  
- Works with V2.070.00 65824, and V2.080.00 252822 and 269486. Other versions can be supported upon request. Contact: discord.gg/lotsofs  
- In case of a game update on Steam, this will break. Please contact me immediately if this happens and I haven't noticed.  
- Autosplitter works but is very dumb. It splits every time the chapter changes. However, it cannot distinguish between what chapter you changed to. This means that if you just load up a map for practice, it will split. It also mean that this is an all or nothing autosplitter. Either have ~7 splits on average per level, or split manually. On the plus side, it recognizes the 'in between levels' part (scorescreen + loading + cutscenes), and it splitting each chapter means it can be useful for ILs.
