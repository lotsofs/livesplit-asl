# Far Cry 2  
Load remover, autostart, autosplit on main mission pass (excluding buddy rescues).  
Simulates a proper game time, since the game-provided timer is bad (pauses in menus, continues in loadings.)   
Special thanks to Pitpo for helping me test the in-game timer: It's bad, do not use.   
Only works with some V1.00 No CD for now. V1.03 doesn't work yet because I can't be arsed looking for addresses if noone is using that version anyway.   
Legit V1.00 will never work because there is no way of getting past that DRM anymore, to my knowledge.   
If you want me to add support for V1.01 V1.02 or V1.03 or whatever contact me twitch.tv/lotsofs (not sure who I'm writing this for.)
